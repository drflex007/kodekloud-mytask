We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose. 
We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:

Install httpd package on App Server 2 using yum and configure it to run on 3002 port, make sure to start its service.

Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.

Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!

Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:

X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block

X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN

X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff

Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

First install httpd server on App Server 2

sudo yum install httpd

after we check server is listening on which port.

using this command -

cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen

and edit the httpd.conf and change the listening port.

Listen - 3002

also change httpd response header at the end of file.

Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff 

save the httpd.conf file 

create the index.html file in the /var/www/html directories.
and paste the content which are mention in the task

echo 'Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!' >> index.html

now we check the changes with the help of browsing the localhost page.

curl -i http://localhost:3002

it will all the details of the apache server
