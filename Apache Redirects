The Nautilus devops team got some requirements related to some Apache config changes. 
They need to setup some redirects for some URLs. There might be some more changes need to be done. Below you can find more details regarding that:



httpd is already installed on app server 3. Configure Apache to listen on port 8086.

Configure Apache to add some redirects as mentioned below:

a.) Redirect http://stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ to http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ i.e non www to www. 
This must be a permanent redirect i.e 301

b.) Redirect http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/blog/ to http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/news/. This must be a temporary redirect i.e 302.



This is virtual host problem.

first we check httpd service is running or not.

systemctl status httpd

after that check which port httpd or apache server listening.
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen

after that we check whether this website redirecting. 
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep redirect

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 

Change the Listen port no -
Listen 8086 

For redirect the url will create main.conf, we will change port no and server name as per task

cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/main.conf

vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/main.conf

add this lines in the main.conf

<VirtualHost *:5002> 
  ServerName http://stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5002/
  Redirect 301 / http://www.stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5002/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:5002> 
  ServerName http://www.stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5002/blog/
  Redirect 302 /blog/ http://www.stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:5002/news/
</VirtualHost>

first virtual host redirect 301 code to perticular site permanentaly.

second virtual host redirect 302 code to perticular site temporarly.

now we start the httpd service 
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

curl -l http://stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:8086/

this will show this site moved permanetaly.

curl -l http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:8086/

This will show the site page.

curl -l http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:8086/blog/

this will show the website moved temporarly

curl -l http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/news/

this will show the website address. 

this will confirm the task.
