We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. 
That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and 
Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 8089 and 8099, respectively. 
We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:

We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.


 iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8089 -j DROP 
[root@stbkp01 clint]# iptables -I INPUT 2 -p udp --dport 8089 -j DROP 
[root@stbkp01 clint]# iptables -I INPUT 3 -p tcp --dport 8099 -j ACCEPT 
[root@stbkp01 clint]# iptables -I INPUT 4 -p udp --dport 8099 -j ACCEPT 


sudo chkconfig iptables on
sudo service iptables save
