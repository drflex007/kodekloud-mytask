The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. 
For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. 
This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named yum_local and make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.

go to the yum repos directory 

create a yum_local.repo file and put these lines in the repo file 

[localyum]
name = localyum
baseurl = file:///packages/downloaded_rpms
gpgcheck = 0
enabled = 1

after that save it and then install samba package using command yum install samba.

this task is so simple but it failed at mine.
 may be the reason is not syncing the repos directories.
