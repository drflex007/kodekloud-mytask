The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . 
App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.

As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Just go to /etc/resolv.conf  file add the google public DNS Server

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

add these line in the file and save  it. 

taks is done.
