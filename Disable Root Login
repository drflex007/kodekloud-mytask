After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. 
One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.

Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

In this task we have to make some chaneg in the sshd configuration file. 

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

press / button for seraching keyword in vi editor

after that type Permit and hit enter

and find that 
#PermitRoot Login yes

remove that # first from the line and change yes to no 
ater that save it ESC :wq 

and restart the sshd service ---> sudo systemctl restart sshd -- this will reload the sshd service.

perform these step on all app servers.

and your task is done.
