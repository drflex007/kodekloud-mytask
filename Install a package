As per new application requirements shared by the Nautilus project development team, serveral new packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
Most of them are completed except for net-tools.

Therefore, install the net-tools package on all app-servers.

Its so simple task i ever seen on Kodekloud platform.
so there would be no explianation at all.
