During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. 
The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. 
These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.

Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host

at the jump server scp -r /home/thor/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/tmp
same has been done to every app server

but i encounter error at db server . after digging i found that there is no openssh-clents package install at db server. 

ssh -l peter stdb01
sudo yum install openssh-clients.

after that transfer all the files same way above.

banner are stored in the /etc/motd , so we have to replace the motd file to the nautilus_banner file.

sudo mv /tmp/nautilus_banner /etc/motd
 it will ask override permission type yes for that. 
 
 and this task has  been done.
