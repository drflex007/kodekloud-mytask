We have some users on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
Some of them have been assigned some new roles and responsibilities, therefore their users need to be upgraded with sudo access so that they can perform admin level tasks.

a. Provide sudo access to user john on all app servers.

b. Make sure you have set up password-less sudo for the user.

First we have to check user is there or not 
id yousuf 
that will show user present or not. 

we have to edit sudoers file in every server.
cat /etc/sudoers | grep yousuf 
vi /etc/sudoers 
open the file entry in the last these line

yousuf      ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD

after that type command 
su yousuf 
this command gives login to user without password less login.
