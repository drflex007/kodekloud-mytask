During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. 
Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. 
Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. 
Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:

a. On App Server 1 at location /var/www/html/news find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.

b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /news on same server.

c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/news directory content.

first we count no of the files in the particular directory.

find /var/www/html/news -type f -name '*js' | wc -l

now we copy all those files in to the desired directory 

find /var/www/html/news -type f -name '*js' -exec cp --parents {} /news \;

now all the mentions files are copied there. now we word count all those files which are copies are there.

run this command at /news directory 

find -type f -name '*js'| wc -l
