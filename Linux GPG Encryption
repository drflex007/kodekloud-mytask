We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.
We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.
Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

Login to storage server.
Go to Home Folder 
Long list all files 

Import Public and Private Keys.

gpg --import public_key.asc 

gpg --import private_key.asc

gpg --list-keys

First encrypt the file from text to asc.

gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armor < encrypt_me.txt -o encrypted_me.asc

type yes 

then ll 

Now decrypt the file from asc to txt

gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt

enter password ---> kodekloud 

ll

validate the task by cat files to confirm

cat decrypted_me.txt
cat decrypt_me.asc

cat encrypt_me.txt
cat encrypted_me.asc

Task is completd
