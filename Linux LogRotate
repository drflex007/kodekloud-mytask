The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
They are expecting significant traffic/usage of tomcat on app servers after that. This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. 
To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log files and retain them for a maximum of 3 weeks. Check the requirements shared below:

a. In all app servers install tomcat package.

b. Using logrotate configure tomcat logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated.

(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)
