The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. 
One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.



Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. 
They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. 
Also, make sure Apache is running on port 6200 on all app servers.

Login to the appserver 1

ssh -l tony stapp01

find out apache service is runnning or not.

For ubuntu - systemctl status apache2
For CentOS - systemctl status httpd
or 
apachectl status 

Found that httpd service is not running.

start the service.

systemctl start httpd

Found that serice are failed to start. 

Look into the journal for logs.

journalctl -xe | grep httpd 
or 
apachectl configtest

Found that Error Message - 
Apache Configuration Error AH00558: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name

for trobubleshooting go to link - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/apache-configuration-error-ah00558-could-not-reliably-determine-the-server-s-fully-qualified-domain-name

add these line in conf file - /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

ServerName=127.0.0.1

after that we run the same command 

systemctl reload httpd
systemctl status httpd

and we got the same error message so we dig into deep and find out that error message--  Apache Network Error AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address

for troubleshooting go to link - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/apache-network-error-ah00072-make_sock-could-not-bind-to-address

ss -4 -tlnp | grep 8089

The flags to the ss command alter its default output in the following ways:

-4 restricts ss to only display IPv4-related socket information.
-t restricts the output to tcp sockets only.
-l displays all listening sockets with the -4 and -t restrictions taken into account.
-n ensures that port numbers are displayed, as opposed to protocol names like â€˜httporhttps`. This is important since Apache may be attempting to bind to a non-standard port and a service name can be confusing as opposed to the actual port number.
-p outputs information about the process that is bound to a port.

now we found that two application are running on same port.

apache and sendmail are running on same port 8089

so we replace the port no of sendmail 

goto directory - /etc/mail/sendmail.mc
     
vi /etc/mail/sendmail.mc

/Port
change the port no of sendmail - 8090

now sendmail are going to listen on the port no 8090

reload the sendmail service.

service reload sendmail

and now restart the apache service.

systemctl restart httpd

and now the httpd service is running fine.

and our task has been completed.
