New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. 
Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.

On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. 
Please do not try to reboot these servers

I login to every three server and check the runlevel and target ( in cent os 7 )
systemctl get-default 
--> multi.user.target 

now i have to change the target to graphical.target for GUI 

systemctl set-default graphical.target
