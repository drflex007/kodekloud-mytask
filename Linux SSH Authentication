  The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and 
  perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly 
  we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). 
  Based on the requirements, perform the following:



Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

First we have to check whether we have any public key or private key at jump server

ls -la ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
and we find there is no directory so we can create a keygen 
ssh-keyen -t rsa -b 4096
 here -t is for encryption method and -b is used for block bit or you can say that password strength. 

don't put any passphrase because we don't want extra password protection. so just enter or you will create a rsa key.

now again we check the key has been created or not.

ls -la ~/.ssh/id_*.
here we find one public key and second one is private key of jump server or you can say that private of our thor bhaiya.

ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
this command ask password of stapp01 server tony user password enter it and boom you successfully copy the public key at stapp01 

now we do the same to another two server or we can do the same for steve and banner bhaiya.

after that we test our user sceneraio 

ssh tony@stapp01
at this time it won't ask password.
