There is some data on Nautilus App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. 
On Nautilus App Server 2, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:

a. Delete all lines containing word following and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

b. Replace all occurrence of word from to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing this string; for example upto, contributor etc.
