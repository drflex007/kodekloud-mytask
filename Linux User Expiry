A developer ravi has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. 
As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for ravi. 
Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named ravi on the App Server 3. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.


First we check user is present on passwd file or not.

cat /etc/passwd 

useradd -e 2021-01-28 ravi

-e is used for editiing users data
chage -l ravi 

chage is used for checking the details about useradd changes.
