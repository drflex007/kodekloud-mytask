There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. 
The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. 
After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.

Look into the issue and fix the same.

check systemctl status mariadb 
journalctl -xe | grep mariadb

find out that there is /var/lib/mysql - chown -operation not permitted.

chown mysql:mysql mysql 

after i check /var/run 
there is mysql folder , there is also sql username 

systemctl start mysql 
systemctl enable mysql.
