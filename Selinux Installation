The xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and came up with ideas to improve the application and server security. 
They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. They are still planning how they will implement it; however, they have decided to start testing with app servers, 
so based on the recommendations they have the following requirements:

Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 2 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now; 
it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host. 
Don't worry about rebooting the server as there is already a reboot scheduled for tonight's maintenance window. 
Also ignore the status of SElinux command line right now; the final status after reboot should be disabled.

first we check selinux is installed or not using yum package manager.
yum info selinux*
and we find out that there is no package of selinux.

so install the package using yum package manager
yum install selinux*

after that we check selinux status 
sestatus
----> selinux=disabled

so again we check at this setting at selinux config file 
cat /etc/selinux/config
here we find that selinux=enforcing.
so we edit the file and changed to selinux=disabled.
and our work is done.

because in the task there is mention that we don't restrat the server.
