The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. 
They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

Install and configure nginx on App Server 3.

On App Server 3 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. 
Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

For final testing try to access the App Server 3 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.


First we check the nginx install or not.
yum install nginx
this will give error nginx comes with epel repositoary 
yum install epel-release
after that install nginx server
yum install nginx

check the nautilus certificate and nautilus key is present in tmp directory

ll /tmp/
we found the in the tmp directory.

now do some changes in the nginx.conf file.

vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

do changes in the server name.
change the ip address.

uncomment all the lines which you find useful.
change the default directory 
ssl_certificate "/etc/pki/CA/certs/nautilus.crt";
ssl_certificate_key "/etc/pki/CA/private/nautilus.key";

save the file.

cp /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/
cp /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/pki/CA/private

ll /etc/pki/CA/certs/

cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep root

ll -lsd /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

rm /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

vi r/share/nginx/html/index.html
Welcome!

: Save the file

systemctl start nginx
systemctl status nginx

run this on your app server 
curl -Ik https://stapp02

run this on jump server
curl -Ik https://stapp02

task is finished.
