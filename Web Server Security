During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on 
Nautilus App Server 1 server in Stratos DC. They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below:



a. On Nautilus App Server 1 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. 
Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/news on App Server 1. 
It was detected that the directory /news lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.

First of all we check whether the httpd service is running.

systemctl status httpd
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -i Tokens
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -i Signature
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Indexes

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

Now we remove Indexes from this line - it will disable file indexing in the apache server.

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 

ServerSignature Off -  makes Apache to hide version info on any error pages.
ServerTokens Prod - However, without the second line ‘ServerTokens Prod’, Apache will still include a detailed server token in HTTP response headers, 
which reveals Apache version number.

add these line last in the file httpd.conf

after that httpd service.

systemctl start httpd

after that curl the website 

curl -l http://stapp03:8080
this commmand output not shows apache version.

curl -l http://stapp03:8080/news

this command output shows us the news direectory permanentaly move somewhere.
